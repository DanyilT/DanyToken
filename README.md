# DanyToken

DanyToken is an ERC20 token implementation using Open Zeppelin contracts. This project includes the smart contract, migration scripts, and configuration for deploying the token using Truffle.

## What have I done

I created a ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is called DanyToken and it was written in Solidity. I used Truffle to compile and ~~deploy~~ test the smart contract. You can find the [smart contract](contracts/DanyToken.sol) right here, I mean in previous few words' link.

> [!NOTE]
> I wrote the smart contract, but I didn't deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain.

## I used

- Solidity
- Node.js
- npm
- Truffle
- Ganache (for local development)
